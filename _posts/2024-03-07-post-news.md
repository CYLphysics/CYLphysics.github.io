2nd prize in the 'A Matter of Taste' Challenge at #QHack2024 !

Our approach involved predicting the phase of a spin system using a classical machine learning model. What's fascinating is that this model, which has M parameters, was trained using a proposed Quantum-Train technique with only polylog(M) parameters, all while preserving the model's accuracy.
This method is similar to, but significantly improved upon, the approach we discussed in our recent arXiv paper (arXiv:2402.16465) a few weeks ago. We are currently in the process of drafting a paper on this topic.
