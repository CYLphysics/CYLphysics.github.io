Chen-Yu Liu is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate Institute of Applied Physics, National Taiwan University, and a research intern at Hon Hai Quantum Computing Research Center. My research interests involve developing algorithms for large combinatorial optimization problems by quantum computing, machine learning applications of quantum circuit experiments, and the QUBO perspective of factorization machines. 


## Background

* PhD in Applied Physics, Natinoal Taiwan University (2021-)
* MS in Physics, National Tsing Hua University (2018-2020) 
* BS in Physics, National Dong Hwa University (2014-2018)

## EXPERIENCE

### Research Intern, Hon Hai Quantum Computing Research Center (2022)

### Apprentice Quantum Researcher, Entropica Labs (2021)
* Graph information reinforcement learning QAOA project  
  - Propose a Graph info. Reinforcement Learning (GiRL) model that can solve 
	QAOA problems. Such model can be trained in smaller Hamiltonian instances
	and shallower QAOA layers and apply to larger instances and deeper QAOA 
	layers. The performance of approximate ratio is similar to Nelder-Mead(NM) 
	with much less number of function evaluations (circuit executions) than NM.

### Research Assistant, National Center for Theoretical Science (2020-2021)
* Machine learning application in quantum many body system
  - Extend the study in master program and preparing a paper for journal publication.


### Master Program, National Tsing Hua University, Department of Physics (2018-2020)
* Machine learning application in quantum many body system:
  - Propose a new approach to predict Hamiltonian-dependent physical quantities such as eigenvalues and dispersion relation in non-perturbative parameter regime from perturbative regime data whose computational time remain almost constantly with respect to increasing system size. The accuracy of prediction can be affected by several parameters. The potential of this method theoretically should including any calculation of Hamiltonian-dependent physical quantities especially in an extremely large Hilbert space system. 
* Teaching assistant of Quantum Mechanics (I), (II) (2019-2020)

### Research Internship,  ACADEMIA SINICA, Institute of  Atomic and Molecular Science (2018)                                                  		           
* Effective quantum theory of molecular system research:
Examine the behavior of an anharmonic coupling model in the strong coupling limit and construct a much simpler effective model.

### College Student Research Scholarship, National Science Council   (2017-2018)

* Geodesic motion of particle around a Kerr-Newman black hole:
  - Examine the dynamics of a particle around  Kerr–Newman black hole. Analytically and numerically determine the parameter regions of the 
corresponding motions, in terms of the initial radius of the orbital motion and the strength of the perturbation. The comparison has been made with 
the motion of a neutral particle in the Kerr black hole.

### Software development internship,  WISTRON NEWEB CORPORATION, Automotive & Industrial Solutions Business Group (2019)
* Developed a tool for testing purposes by C++, python, Linux shell.
Migrate codes from customers to match company’s requirements
