Chen-Yu Liu is a Research Scientist at Quantinuum London and a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Physics at National Taiwan University, advised by Prof. Hsi-Sheng Goan. He specializes in quantum computing, quantum machine learning, and parameter-efficient learning techniques. His research focuses on developing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) and Quantum-Train (QT), which leverage quantum computing to enhance neural network training and model compression. He has published his work at leading AI and quantum computing conferences, including ICLR, ICASSP, IJCNN, QCE, ICTC, and QCNC, contributing to advancements in quantum-enhanced AI models and efficient learning strategies. Previously, he interned at Hon Hai (Foxconn) Research Institute, Jij, and Entropica Labs, where he explored practical quantum algorithms for deep learning and optimization. His long-term goal is to bridge the gap between quantum and classical machine learning, enabling scalable and resource-efficient quantum AI solutions.

* Graph information reinforcement learning QAOA project  
  - Propose a Graph info. Reinforcement Learning (GiRL) model that can solve 
	QAOA problems. Such model can be trained in smaller Hamiltonian instances
	and shallower QAOA layers and apply to larger instances and deeper QAOA 
	layers. The performance of approximate ratio is similar to Nelder-Mead(NM) 
	with much less number of function evaluations (circuit executions) than NM.

* Machine learning application in quantum many body system:
  - Propose a new approach to predict Hamiltonian-dependent physical quantities such as eigenvalues and dispersion relation in non-perturbative parameter regime from perturbative regime data whose computational time remain almost constantly with respect to increasing system size. The accuracy of prediction can be affected by several parameters. The potential of this method theoretically should including any calculation of Hamiltonian-dependent physical quantities especially in an extremely large Hilbert space system.

* Geodesic motion of particle around a Kerr-Newman black hole:
  - Examine the dynamics of a particle around  Kerr–Newman black hole. Analytically and numerically determine the parameter regions of the 
corresponding motions, in terms of the initial radius of the orbital motion and the strength of the perturbation. The comparison has been made with 
the motion of a neutral particle in the Kerr black hole.
