## ACADEMIC WORK EXPERIENCE AND INTERNSHIP

### National Tsing Hua University (2018-2020)
#### Department of physics
#### Master program
##### Machine learning application in quantum many body system:
	 Propose a new approach to predict Hamiltonian-dependent physical
	 quantities such as eigenvalues and dispersion relation in non-perturbative
	 parameter regime from perturbative regime data whose computational time
	 remain almost constantly with respect to increasing system size. The accuracy
	 of prediction can be affected by several parameters. The potential of this
	 method theoretically should including any calculation of Hamiltonian
	-dependent physical quantities especially in an extremely large Hilbert space system.

Institute of  Atomic and Molecular Science 
Summer research internship 
Effective quantum theory of molecular system research:
	Examine the behavior of an anharmonic coupling model in the strong coupling 
	limit and construct a much simpler effective model.

National Science Council                                                                                    July 2017 - Feb. 2018
College Student Research Scholarship
Geodesic motion of particle around a Kerr-Newman black hole:
	Examine the dynamics of a particle around  Kerr–Newman black hole. 
	Analytically and numerically determine the parameter regions of the 
	corresponding motions, in terms of the initial radius of the orbital motion 
	and the strength of the perturbation. The comparison has been made with 
	the motion of a neutral particle in the Kerr black hole.
